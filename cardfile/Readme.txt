Thank you for purchasing this template.

I have left detailed notes throughout the project to help guide anyone interested in making changes of their own. If for any reason you do not understand
sections of the project please contact me directly at Lostheadstudio@gmail.com and I will be happy to assist you further.
 
Attached as a seperate file is the graphics needed to design your own cards.


How to add your own card--------------------------------------------


You create your own cards by opening the project and selecting the "EditorEvents" tab.
From there go to Event number 4, this is where all the cards are stored.

All you need to do is copy one of the events for an already created card and change the values to suit your needs. There is a reference section just below to
help with the card modifiers.


After you have created your card------------------------------------

Add an image to the card object. Create a new animation and name it the same name you gave to your card.



Thats it. Now when you go into your editor the card will be in the list with the rest of them.
